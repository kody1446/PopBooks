# PopBooks
This project was my software development capstone. The mobile application is used to keep track of fundraising during Cub Scout's popcorn season. The app will track inventory, specific sales, recruitments, and report to the appropriate parties when the user requests it.
Below are links to documentation along with a virtual walkthrough of this project.
